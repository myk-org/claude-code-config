# Analyze Project Command

Analyzes a codebase and stores all entities, relationships, and context in the graphiti-memory MCP server.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: 100% DELEGATION ARCHITECTURE

**THE ORCHESTRATOR DOES NOTHING EXCEPT:**
1. Call Task tool to delegate to agents
2. Display agent responses to user
3. Move to next phase

**THE ORCHESTRATOR NEVER:**
- Uses Glob, Grep, Read, or any file tools
- Runs bash commands (except Task delegation)
- Processes data or lists
- Does any logic or calculations
- Calls MCP tools directly

**Each invocation is INDEPENDENT:**
- Treat every `/analyze-project` call as a fresh session
- Do NOT rely on state from previous invocations
- All state is managed by agents and stored in temp files

---

## Usage

- `/analyze-project` - Analyze current project (incremental if exists)
- `/analyze-project --full` - Force full re-analysis
- `/analyze-project --name custom-name` - Use custom group_id

---

## Prerequisites Check

**DELEGATE to graphiti-memory-manager:**

```
Check if the graphiti-memory server is available by calling get_status.

If the call succeeds and returns status: "ok", respond with:
✅ graphiti-memory server is available

If the call fails or returns an error, respond with:
❌ graphiti-memory server is not available
```

**Display agent response.**

**If NOT available, display error and STOP:**

```
❌ ERROR: graphiti-memory MCP server is not available

This command requires the graphiti-memory MCP server to be configured and running.

To set up graphiti-memory:
1. Ensure the MCP server is configured in your ~/.claude.json
2. Verify the server is running and connected to the database
3. Check the server logs for any connection errors

Run this command again once graphiti-memory is properly configured.
```

## Phase 1: Project Initialization

Display: `🔍 Phase 1: Initializing project analysis...`

**DELEGATE to bash-expert:**

```
Initialize project analysis with the following steps:

1. Parse arguments from: ${ARGUMENTS}
   - Check for --full flag (sets IS_FULL_ANALYSIS=true)
   - Check for --name <custom-name> (sets CUSTOM_NAME)

2. Determine project name:
   - If CUSTOM_NAME is set, use it as PROJECT_NAME
   - Otherwise, use $(basename "$PWD") as PROJECT_NAME

3. Set GROUP_ID="${PROJECT_NAME}"

4. Detect project type by checking for configuration files:
   - Python: pyproject.toml, setup.py, requirements.txt
   - Node.js: package.json
   - Go: go.mod
   - Java: pom.xml, build.gradle
   - Rust: Cargo.toml

5. Detect framework from dependencies:
   - Python: FastAPI, Flask, Django
   - Node.js: React, Vue, Angular, Express
   - Java: Maven, Gradle

6. Create /tmp/claude/analyze-project/ directory

7. Write all project info to /tmp/claude/analyze-project/project_info.json:
   {
     "project_name": "...",
     "group_id": "...",
     "working_dir": "$PWD",
     "is_full_analysis": true/false,
     "project_type": "...",
     "language": "...",
     "framework": "..."
   }

8. Return a brief summary:
   🏷️  Project: <project_name>
   📂 Working directory: <pwd>
   🔧 Type: <project_type> (<language>)
   📦 Framework: <framework>
   🔄 Mode: <Full Analysis / Incremental Analysis>
```

**Display agent response.**

## Phase 2: Check Previous Analysis

Display: `🔍 Phase 2: Checking for previous analysis...`

**DELEGATE to graphiti-memory-manager:**

```
Check for previous analysis of the project.

1. Read project info from /tmp/claude/analyze-project/project_info.json
2. Extract GROUP_ID and PROJECT_NAME
3. Call search_nodes with:
   - query: "project metadata ${PROJECT_NAME}"
   - group_ids: ["${GROUP_ID}"]
   - max_nodes: 5

4. If nodes are found, respond with:
   📋 FOUND: Previous analysis exists (X nodes found)

5. If no nodes are found, respond with:
   📋 NOT_FOUND: No previous analysis exists

6. Based on IS_FULL_ANALYSIS flag from project_info.json:
   - If full mode requested: Add "Will perform full re-analysis"
   - If incremental mode: Add "Will perform incremental update"
```

**Display agent response.**

---

## Phase 3: File Discovery

Display: `🔍 Phase 3: Discovering source files...`

**DELEGATE to bash-expert:**

```
Discover source files for analysis:

1. Read project_info.json from /tmp/claude/analyze-project/
2. Determine file patterns based on project_type:
   - Python: **/*.py
   - Node.js: **/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mjs,cjs}
   - Go: **/*.go
   - Java: **/*.java
   - Rust: **/*.rs
   - Unknown: **/*.{py,js,ts,go,java,rs,c,cpp,h,hpp}

3. Find all matching files recursively from current directory

4. Apply smart filtering (EXCLUDE):
   - node_modules/, vendor/, __pycache__/, .git/, .venv/, venv/, .tox/
   - dist/, build/, target/, .gradle/, out/, .next/, .nuxt/, .cache/
   - *.pyc, *.pyo, .eggs/, *.egg-info/
   - .mypy_cache/, .pytest_cache/, coverage/, .coverage
   - tmp/, temp/

2. Check IS_FULL_ANALYSIS flag
3. If IS_FULL_ANALYSIS is true:
   - Copy all_files.txt to files_to_analyze.txt
   - Return: "Full analysis mode: all files will be analyzed"
   - SKIP remaining steps

4. For incremental mode, read all_files.txt
5. Calculate SHA256 hash for each file:
   sha256sum "$file" | cut -d' ' -f1

6. Write current hashes to /tmp/claude/analyze-project/current_hashes.json:
   {
     "path/to/file.py": "sha256hash",
     ...
   }

7. Check if /tmp/claude/analyze-project/previous_hashes.json exists:
   - If NOT exists: This is first analysis, analyze all files
   - If exists: Compare hashes to find changed files

8. If previous_hashes.json exists, compare:
   - New files: in current, not in previous
   - Changed files: different hash
   - Deleted files: in previous, not in current
   - Unchanged files: same hash

9. Write new + changed files to /tmp/claude/analyze-project/files_to_analyze.txt

    📊 Change Summary:
       New files: <count>
       Changed files: <count>
       Deleted files: <count>

   Classes found: <count>
   Functions found: <count>
   Relationships mapped: <count>
   API endpoints: <count>
