# Personal Claude Configuration Template

This is a template for your personal `CLAUDE.md` file. Copy this to `CLAUDE.md` and customize it to your preferences.

> **Note**: Orchestrator rules (agent routing, delegation, etc.) auto-load from `.claude/rules/` - you don't need to include them here. This file is for YOUR personal preferences only.

---

## Code Style Preferences

<!-- Customize how you want code written -->

```
# Example preferences:
- Use single quotes for strings in JavaScript/TypeScript
- Prefer list comprehensions over map/filter in Python
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use trailing commas in multi-line structures
- Prefer explicit type annotations in TypeScript
```

---

## Communication Preferences

<!-- How you want Claude to communicate with you -->

```
# Example preferences:
- Be concise - skip explanations unless I ask
- Always explain complex decisions
- Use technical terminology freely
- Provide context for breaking changes
- Highlight security implications
```

---

## Project Context

<!-- Information about your typical working environment -->

```
# Example context:
- Primary projects located in: ~/git/
- Default Python version: 3.11
- Default Node version: 20 LTS
- Timezone: UTC-5 (EST)
- Preferred package managers: uv (Python), npm (Node)
```

---

## Tools & Environment

<!-- Your specific tool preferences and environment setup -->

```
# Example preferences:
- Editor: VSCode with Pylance
- Terminal: zsh with oh-my-zsh
- Container runtime: Podman (not Docker)
- Cloud provider: AWS
- Preferred testing frameworks:
  - Python: pytest
  - JavaScript: Jest
  - Go: standard testing package
```

---

## Custom Personal Rules

<!-- Any other personal rules or preferences -->

```
# Example rules:
- Always run tests before committing
- Use conventional commits format
- Create feature branches from 'develop' not 'main'
- Never commit .env files (even examples - use .env.template)
- Log all database migrations with timestamps
```

---

## Rule Overrides

<!-- Override or disable specific orchestrator rules from .claude/rules/ -->

Sometimes you need to customize orchestrator behavior for your personal workflow without modifying the rules files themselves. Use these override patterns:

### Disabling Rules Completely

```
# IGNORE RULE: 20-code-review-loop.md
# Reason: Working on quick prototypes, skip mandatory code review

# IGNORE RULE: 30-parallel-execution.md
# Reason: Prefer sequential execution for debugging
```

### Overriding Specific Behaviors

```
# OVERRIDE: Allow direct Bash usage
# For simple commands (ls, pwd, cd), allow orchestrator to use Bash directly
# instead of delegating to bash-expert

# OVERRIDE: Disable mandatory test runs
# Skip automatic test execution after code changes during exploration phase

# OVERRIDE: Allow temp files in project directory
# For this project, allow temp files in ./tmp/ instead of /tmp/claude/
```

### Modifying Agent Routing

```
# ROUTE OVERRIDE: Python tests
# Route Python test execution to test-automator instead of python-expert

# ROUTE OVERRIDE: Markdown documentation
# Route all .md files to general-purpose instead of technical-documentation-writer

# ROUTE OVERRIDE: Quick fixes
# For minor typos or formatting, skip code review and allow direct edits
```

### Conditional Rule Modifications

```
# CONDITIONAL: Code review for critical files only
# Only enforce code review for files in: src/core/, src/security/
# Skip review for: tests/, docs/, scripts/

# CONDITIONAL: Parallel execution by context
# Allow sequential execution for debugging sessions
# Require parallel execution for feature development
```

### Example Personal Override Configuration

```
# My Custom Workflow Overrides

# 1. Skip code review for documentation
IGNORE RULE: 20-code-review-loop.md
SCOPE: **/*.md, docs/**/*

# 2. Allow direct bash for git commands
OVERRIDE: Git operations can use Bash directly
REASON: Git commands are simple and don't need git-expert delegation

# 3. Custom test routing
ROUTE OVERRIDE: All test files (test_*.py, *_test.go) → test-automator
BYPASS: python-expert, go-expert for test execution

# 4. Relax temp file restrictions for data science work
OVERRIDE: Allow temp files in ./data/temp/ for Jupyter notebooks
CLEANUP: Auto-delete files older than 24 hours
```

### How Overrides Work

1. **Precedence**: Personal CLAUDE.md overrides take precedence over rules files
2. **Scope**: Use file patterns or directory paths to limit override scope
3. **Reason**: Document WHY you're overriding (helps future you)
4. **Temporary**: Consider if override should be permanent or temporary

### Best Practices

- Use overrides sparingly - rules exist for good reasons
- Document your overrides clearly with REASON comments
- Review overrides periodically - remove obsolete ones
- Consider if your override should be a rule improvement instead
- Use SCOPE to limit blast radius of overrides

## Template Usage

1. Copy this file: `cp CLAUDE.md.example CLAUDE.md`
2. Remove sections you don't need
3. Customize the remaining sections
4. Add your own sections as needed
5. Commit `CLAUDE.md` to your personal projects or keep it local

**Remember**: This file is for personal preferences only. Orchestrator behavior is controlled by `.claude/rules/*.md` files, but you can override specific behaviors using the Rule Overrides section above.
