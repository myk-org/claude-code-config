# MCP Launchpad (mcpl)

Use the `mcpl` command for all MCP server interactions.

MCP Launchpad is a unified CLI for discovering and executing tools from multiple MCP servers. If a task requires functionality outside current capabilities, always check `mcpl` for available tools.

## mcpl Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `mcpl search "<query>"` | Search all tools (shows required params, 5 results default) |
| `mcpl search "<query>" --limit N` | Search with more results |
| `mcpl list` | List all MCP servers |
| `mcpl list <server>` | List tools for a server (shows required params) |
| `mcpl inspect <server> <tool>` | Get full schema |
| `mcpl inspect <server> <tool> --example` | Get schema + example call |
| `mcpl call <server> <tool> '{}'` | Execute tool (no arguments) |
| `mcpl call <server> <tool> '{"param": "value"}'` | Execute tool with arguments |
| `mcpl verify` | Test all server connections |

---

## Workflow

**Never guess tool names** - always discover them first.

1. **Search first** to find the right tool:
   ```bash
   mcpl search "list projects"
   ```

2. **Get example** for complex tools:
   ```bash
   mcpl inspect sentry search_issues --example
   ```

3. **Call with required params**:
   ```bash
   mcpl call vercel list_projects '{"teamId": "team_xxx"}'
   ```

### Alternative: List Server Tools

If you know which server to use but not the tool name:
```bash
mcpl list vercel    # Shows all tools with required params
```

---

## Error Recovery

If a tool call fails, mcpl provides helpful suggestions:

- **Tool not found**: Shows similar tool names from that server
- **Missing parameters**: Shows required params and an example call
- **Validation errors**: Shows expected parameter types

---

## Troubleshooting

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `mcpl verify` | Test all server connections |
| `mcpl session status` | Check daemon and server connection status |
| `mcpl session stop` | Restart daemon (stops current, auto-restarts on next call) |
| `mcpl config` | Show current configuration |
| `mcpl call <server> <tool> '{}' --no-daemon` | Bypass daemon for debugging |

### Common Issues

- **Server not connecting**: Run `mcpl verify` to test connections
- **Stale connections**: Run `mcpl session stop` then retry
- **Timeout errors**: Increase with `MCPL_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=120`

## For Orchestrator

- Use `mcpl search` or `mcpl list` for discovery
- Delegate actual MCP tool execution to agents
- When delegating, tell agents that MCP servers are available via `mcpl`

## For Agents

- Use the full mcpl workflow above
- Always search or list before calling unknown tools
- Execute tools as needed for your task
